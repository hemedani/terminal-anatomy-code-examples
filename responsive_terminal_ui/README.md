This program is one of the examples from the [Anatomy of a Terminal Emulator](https://www.poor.dev/blog/terminal-anatomy/) blog post.

It draws a basic UI on screen which is responsive to the terminal window size. Meaning that when the user resizes the terminal, the UI redraws itself conditionally depending on how much space it available to it.

To run:

`cargo run`

Be sure to resize the terminal window afterwards to see the effects.
