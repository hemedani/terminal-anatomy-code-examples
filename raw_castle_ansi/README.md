This ansi is one of the examples from the [Anatomy of a Terminal Emulator](https://www.poor.dev/blog/terminal-anatomy/) blog post.

To display the castle in your terminal, `cat` the `castle` file in this directory. Be sure that your terminal window is of sufficient size to display it, otherwise it might get cut.

Be sure to download the file directly (for example by cloning this repository) rather than copy/pasting its contents from the web interface, as special escape characters might be lost in that way and it won't be displayed correctly.
